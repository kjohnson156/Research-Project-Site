### Advice
* Trust, but verify data quality.
* Expect very long delays in getting data. 
* Request clear descriptions of data sources (real time vs snapshot, vs )
  - It's hard to know what you want to analyze if you don't know what's collected.
* Request security clearance and access to the databases directly, *or* sufficiently compensate the database administrator/IR assistant who will spend weeks if not months extracting, processing and merging the data from across campus for you to analyze.
