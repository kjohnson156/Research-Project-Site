## Course Redesign Sustainability on Your campus

-- what did you l earn, 
how can someone go with it? 
what is the futue of this looks like? 
we learned a lot about assessingn coures redesign. that's esssnetail movign forward witth WASC/GI2025 we'll now have good answers. 
any new redesign project comes through, we ehave a vehincle which to assess whether or not it's working. 


### Project Reflection by Team and/or Faculty Involved
* Takeaways that made this project worthwhile?
* Reflect on your participation in the Sustaining Success Course redesigns.
* Include reflections by the team and/or faculty involved.  


### Lessons Learned

-- this is where most impact can  be made on future factuly looking forward. 

* Positive and negative aspects of the project

* Consider including your students' comments about sustaining the course redesigns.  
-- Comments by Erik's 112 class on seeing trends. Demonstrative importance of sharing information.

students are beign eexposed to the reality that tfaculty are working cross disciplinary to oimprove courses and that each discipline doesn't work in a silo. (or shouldn't
works best not in a silo)



### Advice
* Trust, but verify data quality.
* Expect very long delays in getting data. 
* Request clear descriptions of data sources (real time vs snapshot, vs )
  - It's hard to know what you want to analyze if you don't know what's collected.
* Request security clearance and access to the databases directly, *or* sufficiently compensate the database administrator/IR assistant who will spend weeks if not months extracting, processing and merging the data from across campus for you to analyze. 
* Student services data (EOP/Reach/DSS) is very unstable. These student programs tend to manage their own data records and are not consistently or cleanly attached to the more commonly used SIS data.  
* cANNOT BE DONE ALL in one year. too many questions. 


find a place to put the comment that we're a Hioospanic serving institution start of 2016 -- this trend analysis h ighlights that chemistry has 


greater proporiotn of students who  might have a  harder time to adjusting to life in chico (cos they comeo from socal) on top ofo learnign how to be a chemsit. tthey don't have eto learn how to eb successfull in a adapttive way. 
chemistry 111 is seeing htat moreeso othan the average chico state studentt. prior to 2013 or so, a larger percentage was from butte county/service area which is more like chico than socal(or even the bay) area 

this colalboration helps erik learn his students so ohe can understanad how to teach better. 
all the "issues that thte university is talkign aout" HSEI campus, belonging sydnromo, his course is going to have even worose. he has to address it more explicity. 


make sure link to erik's new portfolio is in there. 


There is still about 15% of the class that are simply not prepared for Chemistry 111, they do not meet the entry level requirements in either Math or English. This could result in an inability to reduce the DFW rate below around 15%, regardless of the redesign. 

Redesigns may work to improve the lower performing students to get them out of the failing range, but instructors should be cognisant of the impact a redesign can have on the top performing students. What works for the "D" students doesn't always work with the "A" students.
